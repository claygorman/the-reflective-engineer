It occurs when individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information they encounter (the \\"anchor\\") when making decisions, even when that information may not be relevant or accurate. Subsequent decisions are often made in relation to this initial anchor, which can lead to biased judgments and assessments.","sidebar":"researchSidebar"},"biases/cognitive-bias":{"id":"biases/cognitive-bias","title":"Cognitive Bias - Dunning-Kruger Effect","description":"The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias that occurs when individuals with low ability or knowledge in a particular domain overestimate their competence or skills in that domain. Conversely, individuals with higher competence or expertise may underestimate their abilities.

Instead of considering the proposal on its merits, the person argues that unless the solution meets an impossibly high standard of perfection, it should be rejected in favor of doing nothing or pursuing an alternative that is also unrealistic.","sidebar":"researchSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"About","description":"My name is Clay Gorman, and I am excited to share the journey of creating \'The Reflective Engineer,\' a website born out of my passion for engineering and personal growth.","sidebar":"researchSidebar"},"research-fables-and-philosophies/fox-and-the-grapes":{"id":"research-fables-and-philosophies/fox-and-the-grapes","title":"The Fox & the Grapes","description":"\\"The Fox and the Grapes\\" is one of Aesop\'s fables, a collection of ancient moral stories often featuring talking animals.

It\'s a framework that categorizes human needs and motivations into a hierarchical structure, often depicted as a pyramid with five levels. This theory suggests that people are motivated to fulfill their needs in a specific order, starting with the most basic and progressing to higher-level needs. Here are the five levels of Maslow\'s Hierarchy of Needs, from the foundational to the highest:","sidebar":"researchSidebar"},"research-fables-and-philosophies/platos-allegory-of-the-cave":{"id":"research-fables-and-philosophies/platos-allegory-of-the-cave","title":"Plato\u2019s Allegory of the Cave","description":"Plato\'s Allegory of the Cave explained","sidebar":"researchSidebar"},"research-laws/brooks-law":{"id":"research-laws/brooks-law","title":"Brooks\' Law","description":"Murphy\'s Law is a popular adage that is often stated as:","sidebar":"researchSidebar"},"research-laws/conways-law":{"id":"research-laws/conways-law","title":"Conway\'s law","description":"Conway\'s Law is a principle in software engineering and organizational theory formulated by computer programmer Melvin Conway in 1967.
