# The Fox & the Grapes
"The Fox and the Grapes" is one of Aesop's fables, a collection of ancient moral stories often featuring talking animals. This particular fable tells the story of a fox who sees a bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine. The fox is tempted by the delicious-looking grapes and decides to try and reach them.

The fox jumps and jumps but cannot reach the grapes, no matter how hard it tries. After several attempts, the fox gives up, saying something along the lines of, "Those grapes are probably sour anyway," and walks away in frustration.

The moral of the story is often expressed as "Sour grapes," and it conveys the idea that people tend to disparage things that they cannot have or achieve. It warns against sour grapes as a metaphor for making excuses or belittling something desirable that is out of reach. In essence, the story teaches us not to devalue something simply because we cannot attain it, but rather to accept our limitations gracefully.
