# Moore's Law
Moore's Law is an observation and prediction made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corporation, in 1965. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip, and by extension, the overall processing power of computers, tends to double approximately every two years. In other words, it suggests that the capabilities of microchips and computer technology would consistently and rapidly advance over time.

Moore's Law has held remarkably true for several decades, and it has been a driving force behind the rapid progress in the field of computer hardware and semiconductor technology. As the number of transistors on a microchip increases, computers become smaller, faster, and more powerful. This has enabled the development of more powerful and capable electronic devices, from personal computers to smartphones to data center servers.

However, it's important to note that as transistors continue to shrink and become more densely packed on microchips, there are physical and technological limitations that have made it increasingly challenging to sustain the exact doubling of transistor count every two years. Nevertheless, Moore's Law has had a profound impact on the technology industry and has guided the expectations for advancements in computing power for many years.
