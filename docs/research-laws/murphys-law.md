# Murphy's Law
Murphy's Law is a popular adage that is often stated as:

"Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."

This law is a humorous and pessimistic statement about the unpredictability of life and the tendency for things to go awry, especially at the most inconvenient times. It suggests that if there is a possibility of something going wrong, no matter how remote, it is likely to happen eventually.

Murphy's Law is often invoked in a lighthearted or ironic manner to express the idea that one should be prepared for unexpected setbacks and challenges in any endeavor. While it is not a scientific or formal law, it serves as a reminder to be cautious, plan for contingencies, and maintain a sense of humor when things don't go as planned.
