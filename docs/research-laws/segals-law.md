# Segalâ€™s Law
Segal's Law is a humorous and cynical adage related to software development and project management. While not as well-known as some other laws in the field, it provides insight into the challenges faced by software engineers and project managers. Segal's Law is often attributed to the American software engineer and author Gerald M. Weinberg.

Segal's Law states:

> "A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure."

In the context of software development and project management, this law highlights the potential pitfalls of having too much information or too many conflicting sources of data. It suggests that having multiple sources of information or multiple experts providing conflicting advice can lead to confusion, uncertainty, and decision paralysis.

The law serves as a reminder that while data and expertise are valuable, it's essential to consider the quality and consistency of the information and advice received. Overreliance on data or expertise from multiple sources without a clear framework for decision-making can hinder progress and lead to indecision.

In essence, Segal's Law emphasizes the importance of effective communication, clear decision-making processes, and the need to establish a single, trusted source of information or authority in complex projects to avoid unnecessary uncertainty and confusion.
