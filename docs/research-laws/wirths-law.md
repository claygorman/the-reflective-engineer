# Wirth's Law
Moore's Law is an observation and prediction made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corporation, in 1965. Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip, and by extension, the overall processing power of computers, tends to double approximately every two years. In other words, it suggests that the capabilities of microchips and computer technology would consistently and rapidly advance over time.
Wirth's Law is a tongue-in-cheek observation related to the field of software engineering. It is named after Niklaus Wirth, a Swiss computer scientist who has made significant contributions to the development of programming languages and computer systems. Wirth's Law states:

"Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware is getting faster."

In essence, Wirth's Law highlights the tendency for software to become more resource-intensive and slower in performance over time, even as hardware technology advances and becomes faster and more capable. This humorous adage serves as a reminder that while hardware continues to evolve and become more powerful, software often becomes more complex and feature-rich, which can place increasing demands on the hardware and lead to perceived slowdowns in performance.

The law underscores the importance of software optimization and efficient coding practices to ensure that software can take full advantage of the hardware's capabilities. It also emphasizes the need for software developers to carefully consider the trade-offs between adding new features and maintaining or improving software performance.
