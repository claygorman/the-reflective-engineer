# About
My name is Clay Gorman, and I am excited to share the journey of creating 'The Reflective Engineer,' a website born out of my passion for engineering and personal growth. 
As an engineer myself, I've always been intrigued by the intersection of practical knowledge and philosophical wisdom. 

It became clear that there was a need for a platform where engineers could explore the profound insights of thinkers and apply it to their daily lives.
With this vision in mind, I embarked on the journey of building this website, curating a collection of diverse ideas and thoughts that empower engineers to 
reflect, learn, and grow. 'The Reflective Engineer' isn't just a resource; it's a digital sanctuary for those seeking to 
broaden their horizons and elevate their engineering practice through the power of reflection and wisdom. 

You can find resources on the left hand side.
